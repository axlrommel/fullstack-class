there's a main branch

1. everyone gets a copy of the main branch on their computer: (own computer)
`git clone` or
`git pull`

2. everybody creates its own branch, use a name close to what your story (own computer)
`git checkout -b branch-name`
do whatever work.
`git add`
`git commit`
Once you are done with your work

3. bring changes from main into your branch (locally in your computer)
`git pull origin main` (merges your changes with the changes in main that happened in the mean time)
sometimes you can hav conflicts. 

4. once you have no conflicts, it's time to push your branch up to git
`git push` (your branch to git)

5. now you can merge into main in git (this is done in github)
- create a pull request
- look at the differences between your branch and main with your whole team
- looked by the team
- one person creates the pull request, and other person merges into main
