Software Development Process:

Waterfall Process:
software build similar as a construction project

bad:
lots of unknowns
user to give you feedback quick

Agile Process - Scrum
2 week sprint ( 1 week sprint)

1. User Stories (they do not have technical details): you need this for the project. This was made by a Product Owner

Processes within scrum:
A. Backlog grooming/planning: developers ask questions to the Product Owner.

Prioritize the stories.
Developers come up with a list of technical tasks

1. Build a repo in github
2. script to do so and so
3. html page using bootstrap
4. order is important

Daily Standup (don't last more than 10 minutes): scrum master + developers
- what I did yesterday
- what I'm going to do today
- is anything stopping me

Demo: you want to demo to the user what you did: 1 week or 2 weeks.
quick feedback: Am I on the right track

Retro: Happens at the of the sprint. reflect on that sprint: what was good/bad.
